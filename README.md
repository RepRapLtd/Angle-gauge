# Angle-gauge
3D printed angle gauge

![Conventional angle gauge](/conventional-angle.jpg?raw=true "Conventional angle gauge")

A conventional angle gauge (such as the one above) can't measure the angle of an object with a sharp corner, because the hub of the gauge is the pin about which it rotates.

This design gets round that problem by having a rotating element thatis constrained by its outer edge.

To make it, print the two files base.stl and rotor.stl.  Also print the file protractor.pdf on a - well - on a printer.

Cut round the outside of the protractor print carefully with scissors and glue it in the recess of the base part.  Take care to aligh the 0-180 line at the centre with the cross bar of the print.  The best glue to use is spray mounting tack that comes in a can.

When the glue is set, use a sharp blade to cut the inner part of the paper away.

The FreeCAD design is in angle-gauge.fcstd if you want to change it (for example by making the diameter bigger or smaller).  See https://www.freecadweb.org/
